The health stages Susceptible (S), Infected (I) and Recovered (
R), and B denotes the concentration of vibrios in contaminated water with two transmission paths: environment-to-human transmission and human-to-human transmission.

Susceptible individuals are recruited proportionally to the population size, and can become infected by drinking contaminated water, or by contact with infected individuals. In addition, susceptible individuals might get vaccinated and become permanently immune, or die. Infected individuals are assumed to permanently recover or die. Contaminated water is assumed to be generated by infected individuals, and it cleans up by natural vibrios decayment or by disinfection.
