The health states are susceptible individuals (S), individuals in early treatment (X), infected infectious individuals (I), infected individuals under treatment (T), and infected but not infectious individuals in a latent state (L). 

Susceptible individuals showing symptoms similar to HSV-2 infection can be sent to early treatment X even if they are not HSV-2 infected including false positives. After a treatment period, individuals in X come back to S. Susceptible individuals get infected and progress to I by contacting infectious individuals not in treatment. An infectious individual may go to a Latency state L, go to treatment, or die out. Individuals under treatment progress to a dormant state L or die out. Individuals in the latency state may develop symptoms and go to I, or die out.
